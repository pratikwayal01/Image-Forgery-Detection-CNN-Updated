## 1. Introduction

With the proliferation of sophisticated image editing software, the creation of visually convincing forged images has become increasingly accessible. This poses significant challenges in various domains including journalism, legal evidence, scientific publications, and social media. Detecting such manipulations is crucial for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of digital content.

Traditional image forgery detection methods rely on handcrafted features that often fail to generalize across different manipulation techniques. Error Level Analysis (ELA) is one such technique that has shown promise in identifying areas of an image that have been digitally altered, but it can produce false positives and requires expert interpretation. Deep learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in this domain by automatically learning discriminative features from data. Building upon previous work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of ELA with an improved CNN architecture for enhanced feature extraction and fusion capabilities.

Our contributions include:

1. A novel hybrid framework that integrates ELA features with CNN-based features
2. An enhanced CNN architecture incorporating residual connections and attention mechanisms
3. Advanced feature fusion techniques for improved detection accuracy
4. A precise tampering localization method using a sliding window approach
5. A comprehensive evaluation on the CASIA2 dataset demonstrating superior performance
6. A user-friendly web interface for practical application of the proposed method

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Traditional Methods

Early approaches to image forgery detection relied on pixel-level analysis and statistical features. These methods include analyzing JPEG compression artifacts, color filter array inconsistencies, and noise pattern analysis. While effective for specific types of manipulations, these techniques often fail when confronted with sophisticated editing tools and post-processing operations.

Error Level Analysis (ELA) is a forensic method that identifies areas within a digital image that have been manipulated by examining the error levels introduced during JPEG compression. When an image is edited and resaved, the altered areas exhibit different compression artifacts compared to the original regions. ELA visualizes these differences, making it possible to identify potential forgeries. However, ELA has limitations, including sensitivity to image quality and difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate high-contrast edges and actual manipulations.

### 2.2 Deep Learning Approaches

Recent years have seen a shift toward deep learning-based methods. Various researchers have proposed CNN architectures for detecting median filtering operations, introduced constrained convolutional layers specifically designed for manipulation detection, and developed CNN approaches for extracting features from image patches, demonstrating improved performance over traditional methods.

### 2.3 Localization Techniques

Beyond binary classification, localization of tampered regions provides valuable forensic information. Researchers have proposed fully convolutional networks for pixel-level forgery detection and introduced two-stream networks that combine RGB and noise features for localization. However, these methods often struggle with precise boundary delineation of tampered regions.

## 3. Proposed Method

### 3.1 System Overview

Our proposed system consists of five main components:

1. ELA feature extraction module
2. CNN-based feature extraction with enhanced architecture
3. Feature fusion module combining ELA and CNN features
4. Sophisticated classification module
5. Tampering localization mechanism

Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of our hybrid system.

### 3.2 ELA Feature Extraction

Error Level Analysis works by re-saving an image at a specific quality level and calculating the difference between the original and re-saved versions. This difference highlights areas that have been modified, as they respond differently to recompression.

```python
def extract_ela_features(image_path, quality=90):
    # Load the original image
    original = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')

    # Save and reload the image at specified quality
    temp_filename = 'temp_ela.jpg'
    original.save(temp_filename, 'JPEG', quality=quality)
    recompressed = Image.open(temp_filename)

    # Calculate the ELA by getting the difference
    ela_image = ImageChops.difference(original, recompressed)

    # Amplify the difference for better visualization
    extrema = ela_image.getextrema()
    max_diff = max([ex[1] for ex in extrema])
    scale = 255.0 / max_diff if max_diff > 0 else 1

    ela_image = ImageEnhance.Brightness(ela_image).enhance(scale)

    # Convert to numpy array for further processing
    ela_array = np.array(ela_image)

    return ela_array
```

The ELA features are then processed to extract statistical measures that serve as inputs to our hybrid model:

```python
def get_ela_statistics(ela_array):
    # Extract statistical features from ELA
    features = []

    # Calculate statistics for each channel
    for channel in range(3):
        channel_data = ela_array[:,:,channel].flatten()

        # Basic statistics
        features.extend([
            np.mean(channel_data),
            np.std(channel_data),
            np.median(channel_data),
            skew(channel_data),
            kurtosis(channel_data),
            np.percentile(channel_data, 10),
            np.percentile(channel_data, 90)
        ])

    # Add global features
    features.append(np.mean(np.std(ela_array, axis=2)))
    features.append(np.max(ela_array) - np.min(ela_array))

    return np.array(features)
```

### 3.3 Enhanced CNN Architecture

We build upon the base CNN architecture with several key improvements:

#### 3.3.1 Residual Connections

To address the vanishing gradient problem and enable deeper network training, we incorporate residual connections between convolutional layers. These skip connections allow gradients to flow more effectively during backpropagation, resulting in improved learning dynamics.

```python
class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=stride, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)

        self.shortcut = nn.Sequential()
        if stride != 1 or in_channels != out_channels:
            self.shortcut = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1, stride=stride, bias=False),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
            )

    def forward(self, x):
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        out += self.shortcut(x)
        out = F.relu(out)
        return out
```

#### 3.3.2 Attention Mechanisms

We integrate channel attention modules to emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones. This allows the network to focus on regions that are more likely to contain manipulation artifacts.

```python
class AttentionModule(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, channels, reduction=16):
        super(AttentionModule, self).__init__()
        self.avg_pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(channels, channels // reduction, bias=False),
            nn.ReLU(inplace=True),
            nn.Linear(channels // reduction, channels, bias=False),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, x):
        b, c, _, _ = x.size()
        y = self.avg_pool(x).view(b, c)
        y = self.fc(y).view(b, c, 1, 1)
        return x * y.expand_as(x)
```

### 3.4 Feature Fusion Techniques

A key innovation in our approach is the fusion of ELA-derived features with CNN-extracted features. We employ multiple feature fusion strategies:

1. **Concatenation Fusion**: Directly concatenating ELA features with CNN features
2. **Weighted Fusion**: Applying learned weights to different feature vectors before combination
3. **Attention-based Fusion**: Using self-attention to determine the importance of each feature type
4. **Adaptive Fusion**: Dynamically adjusting the contribution of each feature type based on image characteristics

```python
def fuse_features(ela_features, cnn_features, method="adaptive"):
    if method == "concat":
        # Simple concatenation
        return np.concatenate([ela_features, cnn_features])

    elif method == "weighted":
        # Apply learned weights
        ela_weight = 0.4
        cnn_weight = 0.6
        return np.concatenate([ela_features * ela_weight, cnn_features * cnn_weight])

    elif method == "attention":
        # Self-attention based fusion
        features = np.vstack([ela_features, cnn_features])
        # Calculate similarity matrix
        similarity = features @ features.T
        # Normalize similarities
        attention_weights = softmax(similarity, axis=1)
        # Apply attention weights
        return (attention_weights @ features).flatten()

    elif method == "adaptive":
        # Adaptive fusion based on image characteristics
        ela_variance = np.var(ela_features)
        cnn_variance = np.var(cnn_features)
        total_variance = ela_variance + cnn_variance

        # Calculate adaptive weights
        ela_weight = ela_variance / total_variance
        cnn_weight = cnn_variance / total_variance

        # Apply adaptive weights
        return np.concatenate([ela_features * ela_weight, cnn_features * cnn_weight])
```

### 3.5 Classification Methods

For the final classification stage, we implement and compare several approaches:

1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A binary classifier trained on the fused feature vectors
2. **XGBoost**: A gradient boosting framework optimized for classification tasks
3. **Ensemble Method**: Combining predictions from multiple classifiers for improved robustness

The XGBoost classifier is configured with the following parameters to ensure optimal performance:

```python
classifier = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    max_depth=5,
    use_label_encoder=False,
    eval_metric='logloss'
)
```

### 3.6 Tampering Localization

We implement a sliding window approach for precise localization of tampered regions:

1. The input image is divided into overlapping patches using a stride parameter
2. Each patch is processed to extract both ELA and CNN features
3. The fused features are passed to the classifier to assign a tampering probability
4. A heatmap is generated by aggregating these probabilities
5. The heatmap is thresholded and post-processed to identify tampered regions

```python
def localize_tampering(image_path, model, patch_size=64, stride=16):
    # Load the image
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)

    # Create a heatmap of the same size as the image
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    heatmap = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.float32)
    count = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=np.float32)

    # Extract ELA for the entire image
    ela_image = extract_ela_features(image_path)

    # Create transform for patches
    transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()])

    # Sliding window to extract patches
    for y in range(0, height - patch_size + 1, stride):
        for x in range(0, width - patch_size + 1, stride):
            # Extract patch
            patch = image[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size]
            ela_patch = ela_image[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size]

            # Convert to tensor for model input
            img_tensor = transform(patch)
            ela_tensor = transform(ela_patch)

            img_tensor.unsqueeze_(0)  # Add batch dimension
            ela_tensor.unsqueeze_(0)  # Add batch dimension

            # Get features and prediction
            with torch.no_grad():
                # Extract CNN features
                cnn_features = model.extract_features(img_tensor.float())

                # Extract ELA statistics
                ela_stats = get_ela_statistics(ela_patch)

                # Fuse features
                fused_features = fuse_features(ela_stats, cnn_features.numpy().flatten(), method="adaptive")

                # Predict using classifier
                score = classifier.predict_proba([fused_features])[0, 1]

            # Add to heatmap
            heatmap[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size] += score
            count[y:y+patch_size, x:x+patch_size] += 1

    # Normalize heatmap
    count[count == 0] = 1  # Avoid division by zero
    heatmap = heatmap / count

    # Apply Gaussian blur to smooth the heatmap
    heatmap = cv2.GaussianBlur(heatmap, (15, 15), 0)

    # Threshold the heatmap to create a binary mask
    threshold = np.mean(heatmap) + 0.8 * np.std(heatmap)
    binary_mask = (heatmap > threshold).astype(np.uint8) * 255

    # Find contours in the binary mask
    contours, _ = cv2.findContours(binary_mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

    return heatmap, binary_mask, contours
```

### 4.5 Feature Importance Analysis

We analyzed the importance of different features in our hybrid model using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Figure 3 shows the relative importance of ELA-derived features versus CNN-extracted features.

![Feature Importance](feature_importance.png)

The analysis reveals that while CNN features contribute significantly to the model's performance, the ELA features provide complementary information that helps in cases where CNN features alone might fail, particularly for subtle manipulations and challenging lighting conditions.

## 5. Web Interface Implementation

To make our system accessible to users without technical expertise, we developed a web interface using Flask. The interface allows users to:

1. Upload images for analysis
2. View binary classification results (tampered or authentic)
3. Visualize tampering localization through heatmaps, overlays, and contour detection
4. Compare ELA, CNN, and hybrid results side-by-side
5. Receive detailed information about tampered regions

![Web Interface](web_interface.png)

The web interface is designed with a responsive layout and intuitive controls, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
