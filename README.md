## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture includes:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Residual connections for better gradient flow
- Attention mechanisms to focus on important features
- SVM classifier for final decision making

## Tampering Localization

The system can localize tampered regions in an image using a sliding window approach:

1. The image is divided into overlapping patches
2. Each patch is analyzed by the CNN model
3. A heatmap is generated showing the probability of tampering
4. Contours are drawn around regions with high tampering probability
